This file is an Excel macro created entirely by me. It can be used with any Excel document that does not have existing macros. This macro, SheetNamer, allows for easier renaming of multiple worksheets and can also create a hyper-link enabled list of the worksheets. For more information, such as how to implement this macro in a workbook, and other examples of my VBA code, please email me at johnstonkylew@gmail.com.
