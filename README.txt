SheetNamer allows for easier managing of workbooks with many worksheets. It enables easy renaming of multiple worksheets and can create a hyper-link enabled list of the current worksheets.


To add SheetNamer to a workbook, open Excel and then press alt+F11. Then, drag SheetNamer.bas to the Project Explorer on the left side of the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications window.

To have the status bar reset on click, copy the code form ThisWorkbook.cls to the ThisWorkbook object in the VBA window.

SheetNamer can also be added to the personal workbook.
